# MariborJS - JavaScript Meetups https://www.meetup.com/MariborJS/
### Agenda:

**Session:** Angular + Firebase = ❤
**Speaker:** Janez Čadež 
**Affiliations:** Student on FRI
**Description:**
Imagine you are a frontend developer creating an Angular application, but your app still needs authentication, database and hosting. Daaaamn, this is so time consuming, but is there an easier way?. In this talk we will take a look at how to extend Angular applications with Firebase products like Firebase Authentication, Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Hosting.

**Session:** RxJS
**Speaker:** Jan Kuri 
**Affiliations:** Angular and Bleenco
**Description:**
The Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS) is a set of libraries for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences and fluent query operators that many of you already know from Array in JavaScript. Using RxJS, developers represent asynchronous data streams with Observables, query asynchronous data streams using of many operators, and parameterize the concurrency in the asynchronous data streams using Schedulers. In this talk we will elaborate on a wide variety of observable patterns and look into useful code snippets.

**Session:** QMiner - efficient datamining in node.js
**Speaker:** Jan Rupnik 
**Affiliations:** Institut Jožef Stefan
**Description: **
Node.js and its ecosystem enable fast and easy development of applications. However, data analytics components typically require external tools such as Apache Storm or Spark. In this presentation Jan Rupnik will present how to use or develop scalable data mining components directly from node.js using QMiner. This will be presented through two use-cases: sentiment classification on Twitter and real-time user profiling. Use-cases cover different data modalities (text, social networks, streams), transformations (feature extraction) and algorithms (classification, recommendation).
